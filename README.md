# woodcutter for RuneScape

This library consists of a script to automate the collection of logs in RuneScape. I developed this using Ikov.io because automation is not allowed on the live servers of RuneScape. The program uses the robotjs library and takes screen grabs. It proceeds to look for matching hexcodes and determines whether if it can or cannot cut the tree.
